# Node_mySQL_Project

This project is a mock seller account created using Node and MySQL. When running the program, users can request to see what items the "store" has in stock, and place orders with command line prompts. Once the user had placed their order, the program will provide them with an order summary and total, and ask if they would like to place additional orders. Additionally, the store database will be updated in MySQL to reflect the current inventory amounts. If the user attempts to order a larger quantity than is in stock, the program will provide a console log stating the amount available for purchase, and prompt the user to try their order again based on the inventory levels. 

# Getting Started
Users will need to have Node and MySQL installed on their computer, clone the repository, navigate to the folder using terminal, and will need to run npm install in order to receive the required dependencies. From there, the bamazon.sql file can be added to MySQL, and the program can be run using the *node bamazon.js*. 

# Program Examples
Included in the repository is a series of screenshots to display the basic flow of the program, as well as the inventory unit updates as orders are placed.
